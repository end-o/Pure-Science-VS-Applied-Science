# Pure-Science-VS-Applied-Science
Description of experimental experience between humans and environment and process of creating applied solutions

Pure science is the gathering of new information or the discovery of a new conclusion.

                  PURE SCIENCE
                      VS
                  APPLIED SCIENCE
                 
Earth science covers planet and space

Live science cover organisms and molecular perspective

Physical science covers matter and energy
        Physical science is comprised of physics and chemistry
        
        
Applied science is the practical use of scientific conclusions 

Applied science solutions lead reactions, beahviors, tendencies and responses to reduce anxiety, confusion, and other obstruction of neural progression.

Understanding how able capacity is applied enables better practice of memory preservation

Standing person has active neurons keeping conscious of reason and purpose of standing

Incoming information whether in anticipation or from applied source such as headphones creates static or neurons to collide which create strain and thus lack of memory, confusion 

Lack of abiity to node happens as enrgy from content sources compounds as user fails to locate situations or in-stances to apply ideology from content.

Thought sequence anticipation to understand how applicable concepts such as confusion are to be avoided or cleared up to progress network sequences through pace of intersection or encounter.
ie: person engages in network intersection and explains project progression. After intersection occurance how long before all who were in participation retrieve, add progression or attempt to clarify topic of discussion. 

Time trailing after network intersection "scoping" allows for loaction of in-stance where m-oral is to be spoken to create verbal description of concept of discussion
