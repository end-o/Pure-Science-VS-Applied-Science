# Pure-Science-VS-Applied-Science
Description of experimental experience between humans and environment and process of creating applied solutions

Pure science is the perception of the unknown or the unforseen elemental interactions in space, human interaction and between the species.

Pure science uses evidence to advance conclusions in sensory learning.

Technology is physical objects created through sensory progression and learning as population increases.

                  PURE SCIENCE
                      VS
                  APPLIED SCIENCE
                 
Earth science covers planet and space

Live science cover organisms and molecular perspective

Physical science covers matter and energy
        Physical science is comprised of physics and chemistry
        


Applied science is the practical use of scientific evidential conclusions to create physical objects or "hardware" 

Applied Science allows for the creation of physical solutions to regulate and progress the physical, personal, private and social aspects of the human species. 

Applied science solution to regulate the developement of personality, social traits and characteristics.

Applied science solutions lead reactions, beahviors, tendencies and responses to reduce anxiety, confusion, and other obstruction of neural progression.

Understanding how able capacity is applied enables better practice of memory preservation

Standing person has active neurons keeping conscious of reason and purpose of standing

Incoming information whether in anticipation or from applied source such as headphones creates static or neurons to collide which create strain and thus lack of memory, confusion 

Lack of abiity to node happens as enrgy from content sources compounds as user fails to locate situations or in-stances to apply ideology from content.

Thought sequence anticipation to understand how applicable concepts such as confusion are to be avoided or cleared up to progress network sequences through pace of intersection or encounter.
ie: person engages in network intersection and explains project progression. After intersection occurance how long before all who were in participation retrieve, add progression or attempt to clarify topic of discussion. 

Time trailing after network intersection "scoping" allows for loaction of in-stance where m-oral is to be spoken to create verbal description of concept of discussion

Applied science hardware is to identify the population parameters which create stagnant conditions from ancestors to descendants.
    ie: what objective values create fixation for members of a population after increased reliance on a resource or process.
                OVER ABUNDANT CROP OR OUTDATED BEHAVIOR????
                
Applied Science Solution is to track how and where control choice is applied.
     ie: How many times must one locate "f" to gain width and therefore mass or "fat"
     
Applied Science solution is to help discover what environmental variance enables a boy named “Jimmy” to acquire abilities such as skinny, fat, ugly or handsome.                

Solution is to help create balance between abilities and traits create opportunity to adopt prosocial personality
      SEE BIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL REPO for Further explanation

Solution is to help perception in-stances such as the "or-bit"

Applied Science hardware is to track responses and reactions of irrational occurences and how they were created through tele-sensing experiences.

Applied science solution is to increase awareness of when social sentiment such as nationalism or collectivism is to be implemented.

Applied science solution is to provide on going graphical interpretation of how a person is in response reaction to their subscribed energy symbols such as name, noun and brands.

Behavior overview: As a person responds to subscribed and given symbols, his or her defense mechanism is attached to labels of modes as a result of interaction in electromagnetic fields. 

Applied science solution is to provide graphical interpretation of a persons "Karma" choice control as it is used as a plus minus or pos neg quantum.

Applied science solution is to regulate irrational emotional use before it becomes disordered by tracking the number of instances a person uses emotional response without reason.
